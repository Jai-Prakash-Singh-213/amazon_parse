What is Braun IONTEC?</h5>Braun ION f EC is a combination of negative ion output technology and a specially designed product feature unique to Braun that together offer maximum hair care. The unique ceramic plates with superior heat control is a breakthrough Braun innovation proven to provide healthy and shiny hair.<div class="centerImage"><img alt="" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/B000IJ0U58.09.jpg" width="385"/></div></p></div><p><h5>2. Why are ions important in hair care? </h5>Hair has its own surface charges that lead individual hair Strands to repel each other - a phenomenon we know as static or flyaway (the simplest analogy is to picture two magnets repelling each other then imagine taking away the forces that repel them  so that they meet effortlessly together).</p><p>Once ions Start to interact with the individual hair Strands they enable any flyway or unruly ones to sit next to each other again without pushing each other apart - no sticking out! The result - significantly boosted shine and restored smoothness whilst diminishing unruliness and frizz.</p><div class="half-col last"><p><h5>3. Are there any other extra benefits to Braun IONTEC?</h5>Braun IONTEC works just like a conditioner: the ions continuously minimise the build-up of charges and therefore keep the friction between hair fibres down. Braun IONTEC also encourages weak and damaged hair to hold onto essential moisture supplies meaning hair looks smooth  shiny and healthy.</p></div><div class="break"> </div></div> <p><h4>Whats in the Box</h4></p> <div class="third-col"><div class="centerImage"><img alt="Box content" height="150" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es2.box.01.jpg" width="180"/></div></div> <div class="third-col"><div class="centerImage"><img alt="Box content" height="100" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es2.box.02.jpg" width="200"/></div></div> <div class="third-col last"></div> <div class="emptyClear"></div> <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </div> </div> </div>,None,18:03:2014,None

The Colour Saver technology  the tailored temperature control and a range of further design features ensure that coloured hair if styled gently and optimised for each hair type. The coloured hair is protected from excessive heat and its surface is kept in good condition allowing each individual hair to look and feel best.</p><p><h5>How is Satin Hair Colour Saver straightener different?</h5>Satin Hair Colour Saver straightener is designed to incorporate Braun's Colour Saver technology  consisting of a multitude of features that help to protect hair colour and ensure best styling results. These key features are the tailored temperature control that ensures the optimal temperature for each hair type to achieve best styling results and best protection for hair  and the active ions that help to optimise the surface condition of the hair  help to keep hair moisturised and reduce frizz and flyaways. These help to deliver the best results for coloured hair.</p><p><h5>Why are active ions important in hair care?</h5>Hair has its own surface charged that leads individual hair strands to repel each other – a phenomenon we know as static or flyaway. Once ions start to interact with the individual hair strands  they enable any fly away or unruly ones to sit next to each other again without pushing each other apart – no sticking out! The result – significantly boosted shine and restored smoothness whilst diminishing static and frizz.</p> <p><h4>Styling range from Satin Hair 7</h4></p> <table class="data"><tr><th> </th><th><div class="centerImage"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es3.08.jpg"/></div></th><th><div class="centerImage"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es3.09.jpg"/></div></th><th><div class="centerImage"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es3.10.jpg"/></div></th><th><div class="centerImage"><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/31/misc/es3.11.jpg"/></div></th></tr><tr><td><h4>Key Features</h4></td><td><b>Satin Hair 7 SensoCare</b></td><td><b>Satin Hair 7 Color Saver</b></td><td><b>Satin Hair 7 IONTEC</b></td><td><b>Satin Hair 5 Multistyler</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>SensoCare Technology</b><br>Built-in sensors detects the individual condition of each hair strand and adapts temperature</br></td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Automatic temperature adaption</b><br>Continously adapts temperature from root to tip for ultimate heat protection</br></td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Advanced display guidance</b><br>Gives feedback on your styling process</br></td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Curl shaper</b><br>To enable creation of curls</br></td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><b>Anti-color fading</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Color saver technology</b><br>For longer lasting vibrant colour</br></td><td>-</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>IONTEC</b><br>Tame fizz and static for healthy smoothness and shine</br></td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Active ion technology</b><br>For wonderful shiny and healthy smoothness and shine</br></td><td>-</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Manual temperature regulation possible</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Plates</h4></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><b>Nanoglide ceramic plates</b><br>For 3x smoother gliding vs convectional plates</br></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Patented floating plates</b><br>For even distribution of pressure on hair</br></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><b>Accurate heat control</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Other Features</h4></td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><b>Auto shut off</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><b>Swivel cord 2m</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td><b>Possibility to store 3 personalized profiles</b></td><td>Y</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Temperature memory function</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>degree celcius max function/boost function</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cool tip for maximum control/two hand operation</b></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr></table> </div> <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </div> <h3 class="productDescriptionSource">Product Description</h3> <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">        Perfectly suited to match the special needs of coloured hair.
