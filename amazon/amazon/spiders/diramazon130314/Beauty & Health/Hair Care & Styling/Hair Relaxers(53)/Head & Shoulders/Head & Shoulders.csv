Actually  the dandruff condition is harsh on hair. Scientific discoveries have shown that a scalp that is itchy or dry with dandruff has a negative effect on your hair’s shine. The itching and scratching that can accompany dandruff can also increase hair damage due to scratching. Our shampoo formulas are gentle and pHs balanced  and have six times the moisturisers of most non-conditioning shampoos so they always leave hair soft and manageable. All our shampoos are gentle enough for daily use – even on colour-treated hair. Plus  our conditioners are rich in intensive moisturisers that leave hair feeling silky and soft.  </p><p><h5>What is the best way to use head &amp; shoulders to fight dandruff? </h5> Simple: regular use will ease flakes and itching. Ideally  you should wash with head and shoulders at least three times a week for visibly flake-free hair.   All head &amp; shoulders shampoos are gentle enough to use every time you shampoo. If you use a conditioner  ensure it’s an anti-dandruff one. Doing so increases the effectiveness (vs. cosmetic conditioner). If you use an ordinary conditioner  you rinse away up to 70% of the dandruff-fighting ingredient  ZPT  which is deposited by head &amp; shoulders shampoo  and lessen your chances of fighting dandruff. By replacing your conditioner with head &amp; shoulders conditioner  you could increase dandruff-fighting effectiveness by up to 78%.  </p><p><h5>I know head &amp; shoulders helps protect my scalp  but are there any benefits for my hair? </h5> Definitely. You can think of our products as anti-dandruff shampoos and conditioners that give you beautiful hair as well as superb shampoos and conditioners that happen to clear – and fight – dandruff. Whether you use a shampoo alone or with one of our conditioners  you’ll have hair that’s soft  manageable  and shiny – and which smells gorgeous  too.  </p><p><h5>If I keep using head &amp; shoulders  will it lose its effectiveness over time? </h5> No  you'll enjoy the same dandruff protection from head &amp; shoulders for as long as you use it. You won't become unresponsive to the active dandruff-fighting ingredients  nor will the effectiveness of the dandruff-fighting agents decline.  </p><p><h5>What are the most common ways to treat dry scalp and care for dandruff? </h5> You can treat a dry scalp and take care of dandruff with products containing at least one of the following types of active ingredients:  </p><p>Anti fungal ingredients reduce the amount of fungus on the scalp  therefore fighting the leading cause of dandruff. These ingredients include Zinc Pyrithione (ZPT) and selenium sulfide.  </p><p>Anti-proliferative agents slow down the production of skin cells without necessarily acting directly against the fungus. One such ingredient is coal tar  which primarily fights signs of dandruff.  </p><p>Keratolytic agents break down the intercellular bond (keratin) that holds skin cells together on the uppermost layer of the scalp. Therefore  when the top layer of cells are shed  they are separate rather than in clumps. These agents include sulfur and salicylic acid  which  again  primarily fights signs and not the cause of dandruff.  </p><p><h5>Why don't antidandruff shampoos get rid of dandruff forever? Why do flakes come back? </h5> Malassezia  the leading cause of dandruff  is a naturally occurring fungus which is found on everyone's skin. Some people are more sensitive to its presence than others; those who are more sensitive develop dandruff. Malassezia can be controlled by regular treatment with head &amp; shoulders shampoos and conditioners. However  if treatment stops  the fungus will naturally return — along with the flaky by-products.  </p></div><div class="emptyclear"></div> <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </div> <h3 class="productDescriptionSource">Product Description</h3> <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">        Go from dry and frizzy hair to smooth and silky hair in just one rinse. Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Conditioner is formulated with added moisturizers restores dry  frizzy hair and helps to  lock in dandruff-fighting power to leave you with beautiful  soft and manageable hair.
