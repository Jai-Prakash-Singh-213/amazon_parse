Each piece makes a statement and a ‘bold and beautiful’ one at that! Is it the color  style  stone cut or bead  guess all of it with the creative eye of the designer that makes it come alive for “YOU”  breaking the thinking norms of traditional jewelry and modern bijou. The materials used are semi-precious stones like rose quartz  jade  onyx with Kundan work  ceramic  velvet pearls and crystals in three dimensional formats. This in itself sets the offering apart from anything available and existing. One can sense a soul of creativity and a keen eye for beauty in the entire collection making the wearer so comfortable and at ease that it seems as her own extension.  Behold the sight of materials as diverse and dramatic as a textured antique golden brass sphere and fresh water pearls or kundan work on amber-hued coral  strewn in a green jade necklace. If this makes you feel rustic and grounded then get prepared for a flight of finesse and fantasy  turquoise beads strewn as a necktie with shimmering crystals  cascading and rippling  an ethereal sight indeed. Even though they have been combined and equated with such ease and élan  an aura of mystery surrounds these hand-crafted ‘conversation starters’. There is nothing predictable about them and you are left asking for more.  A visual treat all the way.</p> <p>Statement jewellery is not only fashionable but its bold sensibility portrays the confidence of the wearer.

Each piece makes a statement and a ‘bold and beautiful’ one at that! Is it the color  style  stone cut or bead  guess all of it with the creative eye of the designer that makes it come alive for “YOU”  breaking the thinking norms of traditional jewelry and modern bijou. The materials used are semi-precious stones like rose quartz  jade  onyx with Kundan work  ceramic  velvet pearls and crystals in three dimensional formats. This in itself sets the offering apart from anything available and existing. One can sense a soul of creativity and a keen eye for beauty in the entire collection making the wearer so comfortable and at ease that it seems as her own extension.  Behold the sight of materials as diverse and dramatic as a textured antique golden brass sphere and fresh water pearls or kundan work on amber-hued coral  strewn in a green jade necklace. If this makes you feel rustic and grounded then get prepared for a flight of finesse and fantasy  turquoise beads strewn as a necktie with shimmering crystals  cascading and rippling  an ethereal sight indeed. Even though they have been combined and equated with such ease and élan  an aura of mystery surrounds these hand-crafted ‘conversation starters’. There is nothing predictable about them and you are left asking for more.  A visual treat all the way.</p> <p> Statement jewellery is not only fashionable but its bold sensibility portrays the confidence of the wearer. Today’s woman likes to make a mark with her style sensibilities. Karmic Kabira by Vandana Dewan introduces such classic statement pieces. The party collection is a treasure trove of statement pieces that are versatile enough to be paired with a classic LBD as well as a cocktail saree with equal ease and elan.
