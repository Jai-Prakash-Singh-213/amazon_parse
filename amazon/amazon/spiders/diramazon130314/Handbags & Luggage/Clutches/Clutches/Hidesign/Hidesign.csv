Since 1978  Hidesign has slowly and painstakingly built its reputation around the sensuous naturalness of its high quality leathers and beautifully handcrafted bags. Hidesign’s passion to be ecologically conscious has made it a leader in the field of vegetable tanned leathers and artisan crafted solid brass buckles. For Hidesign it is an elegance that is rooted in the quality of the product and innovation of its designs.</p><p>Hidesign sees great value in natural beauty. Our products are all individually handcrafted using the finest leathers  many of which are purely vegetable-tanned using natural seeds and barks in our own tanneries. Our leathers are full grain and have not been corrected with paint and pigment to hide natural defects. The natural and ecological tanning process enhances the intrinsic characteristics and individuality of our leathers and gives our leathers a tremendous strength and durability. In addition  our solid brass buckles are individually sand cast and hand polished  reflecting old saddlery traditions. The solid brass buckles and fittings enhance the natural look of our product as well the durability of the product. Each bag is therefore  by its nature  a limited edition.</p><p><b>USP</b> – Eco-friendly  natural grained  vegetable tanned leathers and solid brass hardware come together to create beautifully handcrafted bags.</p><p><b>Product range</b> – Handbags  evening bags  clutches  briefcases  messengers  laptop and ipad sleeves  back packs  leather garments  duffle bags  luggage on wheels  belts  wallets and small leather goods.</p></div><div class="emptyClear"></div> <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </div> </div> </div>,<div align="left" class="bucket" id="techSpecSoftlinesWrap"><h2>Product Specifications </h2> <div class="content"> <div id="techSpecSoftlines"> <table cellspacing="0"> <tr> <th colspan="2"> </th> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Model Number</td> <td class="td2">                                             8903439326210                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Item Height</td> <td class="td2">                                             25 Centimeters                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Item Length</td> <td class="td2">                                             25 Centimeters                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Item Width</td> <td class="td2">                                             25 Centimeters                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Item Weight</td> <td class="td2">                                             500 Grams                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Material</td> <td class="td2">                                             Leather                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Warranty Description</td> <td class="td2">                                             1 year domestic warranty on manufacturing defects                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="td1">Warranty Type</td> <td class="td2">                                             Manufacturer                                         </td> </tr> </table> </div> </div> </div>,18:03:2014,None
