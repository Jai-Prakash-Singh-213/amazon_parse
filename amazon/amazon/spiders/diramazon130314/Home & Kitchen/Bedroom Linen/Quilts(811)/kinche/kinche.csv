These quilts are perfect for summers and can be layered for winters. Made with the softest voile cotton  they are luxurious to cuddle up with.  About These Quilts &amp; History : The art of block printing began in the 18th century in Rajasthan and the craft has been passed down from generation to generation. The finest contemporary block printing is still found in this area. Block printing has become popular because it can create intricate design  depth and texture in rich and vibrant colors. The main tools of the printer are wooden blocks in different shapes. Each block is hand carved from seasoned teak wood by skilled artisans. The new blocks are soaked in oil for 10-15 days to soften the grain in the timber. The filling is finely carded cotton which has had all the impurities removed. In the process of carding  a dense cotton ball becomes light and fluffy. To make a quilt  a worker will start with approximately 2.2 lbs. of cotton. After undergoing carding for a week  only about 3.5 ounces of cotton remain. The cotton is separated into as many cotton fibers as possible. This light fluffy cotton is what makes these quilts so warm. nce the cotton is fully carded  the artisans are ready to assemble the quilts. The quilts must have several layers of very thin and fluffy cotton evenly distributed throughout the quilt. This is an essential step to maintain the comfort and warmth of the quilts  which are 100% cotton. Once the filling is evenly distributed  the quilt is stitched together and quilted by hand. Hope you enjoy this quilt as much as we enjoyed creating it! xoxo              <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </div> </div> </div>,None,18:03:2014,None

About These Quilts &amp; History : The art of block printing began in the 18th century in Rajasthan and the craft has been passed down from generation to generation. The finest contemporary block printing is still found in this area. Block printing has become popular because it can create intricate design  depth and texture in rich and vibrant colors. The main tools of the printer are wooden blocks in different shapes. Each block is hand carved from seasoned teak wood by skilled artisans. The new blocks are soaked in oil for 10-15 days to soften the grain in the timber. The filling is finely carded cotton which has had all the impurities removed. In the process of carding  a dense cotton ball becomes light and fluffy. To make a quilt  a worker will start with approximately 2.2 lbs. of cotton. After undergoing carding for a week  only about 3.5 ounces of cotton remain. The cotton is separated into as many cotton fibers as possible. This light fluffy cotton is what makes these quilts so warm. nce the cotton is fully carded  the artisans are ready to assemble the quilts. The quilts must have several layers of very thin and fluffy cotton evenly distributed throughout the quilt. This is an essential step to maintain the comfort and warmth of the quilts  which are 100% cotton. Once the filling is evenly distributed  the quilt is stitched together and quilted by hand.

About These Quilts &amp; History : The art of block printing began in the 18th century in Rajasthan and the craft has been passed down from generation to generation. The finest contemporary block printing is still found in this area. Block printing has become popular because it can create intricate design  depth and texture in rich and vibrant colors. The main tools of the printer are wooden blocks in different shapes. Each block is hand carved from seasoned teak wood by skilled artisans. The new blocks are soaked in oil for 10-15 days to soften the grain in the timber. The filling is finely carded cotton which has had all the impurities removed. In the process of carding  a dense cotton ball becomes light and fluffy. To make a quilt  a worker will start with approximately 2.2 lbs. of cotton. After undergoing carding for a week  only about 3.5 ounces of cotton remain. The cotton is separated into as many cotton fibers as possible. This light fluffy cotton is what makes these quilts so warm. nce the cotton is fully carded  the artisans are ready to assemble the quilts. The quilts must have several layers of very thin and fluffy cotton evenly distributed throughout the quilt. This is an essential step to maintain the comfort and warmth of the quilts  which are 100% cotton. Once the filling is evenly distributed  the quilt is stitched together and quilted by hand.
