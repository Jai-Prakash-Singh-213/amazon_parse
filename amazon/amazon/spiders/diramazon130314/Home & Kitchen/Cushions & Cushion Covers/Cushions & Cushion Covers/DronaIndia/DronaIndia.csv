The Varanasi brocades are woven in silk  with profuse use of metal threads borders. The weavers are known as karigars  which means artists  who weave in workshops called karkhanas  Almost every inch of space in the karkhana is taken up by looms  and above each loom hangs a crowded arrangement of strings leading down to the room heddles. The zari thread  known as kalabattun  consists of finely drawn gold  silver or base metal thread  wound round a silk thread. The most famed of Varanasi brocaded textile is called kinkhab woven with a coarse but durable silk known as mukta  which is heavy enough to take brocading with silver or gold thread. The silk-and-zari-work brocade of lighter material and less heavier ornamentation is known as bafta and the brocade without any metal thread work is known as amaru. Benaras brocades are woven on pitlooms.              <div class="emptyClear"> </div> </p></div> </div> </div>,None,18:03:2014,None

The Varanasi brocades are woven in silk  with profuse use of metal threads borders. The weavers are known as karigars  which means artists  who weave in workshops called karkhanas  Almost every inch of space in the karkhana is taken up by looms  and above each loom hangs a crowded arrangement of strings leading down to the room heddles. The zari thread  known as kalabattun  consists of finely drawn gold  silver or base metal thread  wound round a silk thread. The most famed of Varanasi brocaded textile is called kinkhab woven with a coarse but durable silk known as mukta  which is heavy enough to take brocading with silver or gold thread. The silk-and-zari-work brocade of lighter material and less heavier ornamentation is known as bafta and the brocade without any metal thread work is known as amaru.

The Varanasi brocades are woven in silk  with profuse use of metal threads borders. The weavers are known as karigars  which means artists  who weave in workshops called karkhanas  Almost every inch of space in the karkhana is taken up by looms  and above each loom hangs a crowded arrangement of strings leading down to the room heddles.
